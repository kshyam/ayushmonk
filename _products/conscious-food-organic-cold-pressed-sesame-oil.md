Indulge in the nourishing benefits of **HESTHETIC Virgin Cold Pressed White Sesame (Gingelly) Oil**, a 100% pure and unrefined oil extracted using traditional cold-press methods to preserve all its natural goodness. Sourced from premium white sesame seeds, this virgin oil is rich in essential nutrients, antioxidants, and healthy fats, making it the ideal choice for cooking as well as skincare and hair care routines.

HESTHETIC Cold Pressed Sesame Oil adds a mild, nutty flavor to your meals while providing exceptional health benefits.

Its deeply moisturizing properties also make it perfect for hydrating skin and strengthening hair. Completely free of additives and chemicals, this multipurpose oil offers a natural solution for daily health and beauty care.

### Benefits:
- **Heart Health**: Packed with healthy unsaturated fats that support cardiovascular health and help lower bad cholesterol (LDL).
- **Antioxidant Power**: Contains powerful antioxidants like sesamol and vitamin E, which protect cells from damage and reduce signs of aging.
- **Supports Digestion**: Promotes digestive health by soothing inflammation and improving gut function.
- **Moisturizes Skin**: Deeply nourishes and hydrates the skin, reducing dryness, wrinkles, and enhancing skin elasticity for a radiant look.
- **Strengthens Hair**: Conditions the scalp, strengthens hair roots, reduces dandruff, and promotes thicker, shinier hair.
- **Multipurpose Use**: Ideal for oil pulling, Ayurvedic massage (Abhyanga), and detoxifying the body naturally.

### How to Use:
1. **For Cooking**: Use **HESTHETIC Virgin Sesame Oil** in your daily cooking. Its delicate, nutty flavor complements both traditional dishes and modern recipes. Perfect for sautéing, stir-frying, salad dressings, and as a drizzle over warm dishes to enhance flavor.

2. **For Skin Care**: Apply the oil to clean skin for deep hydration. Use it after a shower or before bed as a natural moisturizer, massaging it gently into the skin for a smooth, glowing complexion.

3. **For Hair Care**: Massage the oil into your scalp and hair for nourishment. Leave it on for 30 minutes or overnight before washing. This routine helps reduce hair fall, hydrates dry scalp, and restores shine and strength to your hair.

4. **Oil Pulling**: Swish 1 tablespoon of sesame oil in your mouth for 10-15 minutes on an empty stomach. Spit it out and rinse with warm water to detoxify the mouth, reduce plaque, and promote gum health.

5. **Ayurvedic Massage (Abhyanga)**: Warm the oil slightly and use it for a relaxing full-body massage. It helps improve circulation, nourish the skin, and relieve muscle tension.
