### How to Use:
1. **For Cooking**: Use **KLF Tilnad 100% Pure Sesame Oil** in daily cooking to add a rich, nutty flavor to your meals. It's perfect for stir-frying, sautéing, deep-frying, and tempering. You can also drizzle it over salads or use it in marinades.
   
2. **For Skin Care**: Apply a small amount of the oil to your skin and massage gently. Use it as a natural moisturizer for hydrated, radiant skin. Apply after a shower or as part of your nighttime skincare routine.

3. **For Hair Care**: Warm the oil slightly and massage it into your scalp and hair. Leave it on for 30 minutes or overnight before washing with a mild shampoo. Regular use will nourish your scalp, strengthen hair, and reduce dandruff.
