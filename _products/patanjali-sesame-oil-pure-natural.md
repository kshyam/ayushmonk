### How to Use:
1. **For Cooking**: Use **Patanjali Sesame Oil** in your daily cooking for heart-healthy meals. It’s perfect for sautéing, stir-frying, deep-frying, and adding flavor to salads and pickles. Its mild, nutty taste enhances the flavors of both traditional and modern recipes.
   
2. **For Skin Care**: Apply directly to the skin as a natural moisturizer. Massage it gently after a bath to lock in moisture or use it as a night treatment to nourish and hydrate your skin for a healthy glow.

3. **For Hair Care**: Massage the oil into your scalp and hair for deep nourishment. Leave it on for 30 minutes or overnight before washing. Regular use reduces hair fall, dandruff, and promotes stronger, shinier hair.

4. **Oil Pulling**: Take 1 tablespoon of sesame oil and swish it in your mouth for 10-15 minutes on an empty stomach. Spit it out and rinse with warm water to detoxify your mouth, reduce plaque, and improve gum health.
