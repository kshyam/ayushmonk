This 100% natural oil is extracted using the traditional cold-pressed method, ensuring that it retains all its essential nutrients, vitamins, and antioxidants. With no chemicals, additives, or refining processes, it offers the purest, most authentic sesame oil for all your culinary, skin, and wellness needs.

Cold-pressed sesame oil has been used for centuries in Indian kitchens and Ayurveda for its rich flavor and versatile benefits. Whether you’re using it for sautéing, deep-frying, or as a flavorful salad dressing, this oil enhances the taste of any dish with its mild, nutty aroma. Beyond cooking, Tata Sesame Oil is a powerful addition to your skincare routine, helping to nourish and moisturize your skin and hair.

Packed with healthy fats, vitamins E and K, and antioxidants, this oil not only promotes heart health but also supports healthy digestion and boosts your immune system.

### Benefits:
- **Rich in Healthy Fats**: Packed with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which support heart health and help regulate cholesterol levels.
- **Antioxidant-Rich**: Contains sesamol and sesamin, powerful antioxidants that help protect the body from free radicals, slowing the aging process.
- **Promotes Skin & Hair Health**: Its natural moisturizing properties nourish the skin, leaving it soft and radiant. It also strengthens hair and reduces dryness and split ends.
- **Supports Digestion**: Helps maintain a healthy digestive system by promoting bowel regularity.
- **Boosts Immunity**: Contains zinc and other essential minerals that support the immune system and overall well-being.
- **Ayurvedic Wellness**: Used in Ayurvedic practices for oil pulling and Abhyanga (self-massage), promoting detoxification and relaxation.

### How to Use:
1. **For Cooking**: Use Tata Simply Pure and Unrefined Cold Pressed Sesame Oil in your daily cooking. Ideal for sautéing, stir-frying, or as a dressing for salads and marinades. Its nutty flavor enhances both Indian and global cuisines.
   
2. **For Skincare**: Apply a small amount of the oil directly to your skin. Massage gently in circular motions to hydrate and nourish your skin. Leave on for 20-30 minutes before washing off, or leave overnight for intense hydration.

3. **For Haircare**: Massage the oil into your scalp and hair, leave it on for 30 minutes, then wash with a gentle shampoo. This promotes healthy, shiny hair and reduces dandruff.

4. **Oil Pulling**: Take 1 tablespoon of sesame oil and swish it in your mouth for 15-20 minutes in the morning on an empty stomach. Spit it out and rinse your mouth with warm water. This Ayurvedic practice helps detoxify the body and promote oral health.

5. **Self-Massage (Abhyanga)**: Warm the oil slightly and apply it generously all over the body. Massage deeply into the skin to nourish and soothe muscles. Leave the oil on for 20-30 minutes before bathing.
