### Product Title:
**Anjali Cold Pressed Gingelly/Sesame Oil – 100% Pure, Unrefined, Chemical-Free Oil for Cooking, Skin, and Hair Health**

### Description:
Introducing **Anjali Cold Pressed Gingelly/Sesame Oil**, a premium, all-natural oil extracted from high-quality sesame seeds using traditional cold-pressing methods. This process ensures that the oil retains all its essential nutrients, vitamins, and antioxidants, offering the purest form of sesame oil available. Completely free from chemicals, preservatives, and additives, this versatile oil is ideal for cooking, skincare, and hair care routines.

Packed with healthy fats and nutrients, Anjali Sesame Oil enhances the flavor of your dishes with its subtle, nutty aroma and delivers numerous health benefits. Rich in antioxidants and essential fatty acids, it promotes heart health, supports digestion, and boosts immunity. Additionally, its moisturizing and anti-inflammatory properties make it perfect for nourishing the skin and hair, reducing dryness, and promoting a youthful glow.

Whether you’re using it in your daily cooking, for oil pulling, or as a skincare and hair care remedy, Anjali Cold Pressed Gingelly Oil is a must-have in every household, blending tradition with modern wellness.

### Benefits:
- **Heart Health**: Rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, it supports cardiovascular health by lowering bad cholesterol (LDL) and increasing good cholesterol (HDL).
- **Promotes Digestion**: Helps improve digestion and maintains gut health, providing relief from constipation and supporting regular bowel movements.
- **Boosts Immunity**: Contains antioxidants, zinc, and essential nutrients that enhance the body’s immune response and protect against free radical damage.
- **Skin Nourishment**: Acts as a natural moisturizer, keeping skin hydrated, soft, and glowing. The anti-inflammatory properties also help soothe irritated skin and combat signs of aging.
- **Strengthens Hair**: Deeply conditions the scalp, reduces dandruff, and promotes healthy, shiny hair. Regular use helps prevent split ends and nourishes dry, brittle hair.
- **Oral Health**: Known for its use in oil pulling, it helps detoxify the mouth, reduce plaque, and promote healthy gums and teeth.

### How to Use:
1. **For Cooking**: Use Anjali Cold Pressed Gingelly Oil in everyday cooking. Its mild, nutty flavor makes it perfect for stir-frying, sautéing, and as a base for curries or salad dressings. It is also ideal for deep-frying due to its high smoke point.
   
2. **For Skin Care**: Apply a few drops of the oil to your skin after a shower or before bed. Massage gently to lock in moisture and keep your skin soft and supple. It can also be used to soothe dry patches or skin irritations.

3. **For Hair Care**: Warm a small amount of oil and massage it into your scalp and hair. Leave it on for 30 minutes or overnight, then wash with a mild shampoo. This helps nourish your hair, reduce frizz, and add shine.

4. **Oil Pulling**: Swish 1 tablespoon of sesame oil in your mouth for 10-20 minutes in the morning before brushing. This Ayurvedic practice detoxifies the mouth, improves oral health, and freshens breath.

5. **Self-Massage (Abhyanga)**: Warm the oil slightly and use it for a full-body massage. Massage gently in circular motions and leave on for 20-30 minutes before rinsing off. This relaxes the muscles, improves circulation, and nourishes the skin.
