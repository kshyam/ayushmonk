### Benefits:
- **Heart-Healthy**: Rich in unsaturated fats, especially omega-3 and omega-6, which help lower bad cholesterol (LDL) and promote heart health.
- **High in Antioxidants**: Contains sesamin, sesamol, and vitamin E, powerful antioxidants that fight free radicals and protect against oxidative stress.
- **Improves Digestion**: Supports digestive health by easing inflammation and promoting gut regularity.
- **Nourishes Skin**: Acts as a deep moisturizer, leaving skin soft and supple. It also helps reduce signs of aging and improves skin elasticity.
- **Strengthens Hair**: Helps combat hair fall, strengthens hair follicles, and promotes healthy, shiny hair. It also reduces dandruff and dryness.
- **Oil Pulling & Ayurvedic Benefits**: Ideal for oil pulling to improve oral health, detoxify the body, and enhance overall wellness.

### How to Use:
1. **For Cooking**: Use **Puvi Cold Pressed Sesame Oil** in daily cooking. It’s perfect for sautéing, stir-frying, deep-frying, and tempering. The oil's mild, nutty flavor enhances traditional Indian dishes as well as contemporary recipes like salads, dressings, and marinades.
   
2. **For Skin Care**: Apply the oil directly to your skin for deep moisturization. It hydrates and nourishes the skin, leaving it soft and glowing. Use it after a shower or as part of your nighttime skincare routine for best results.

3. **For Hair Care**: Warm the oil slightly and massage it into your scalp and hair. Leave it on for 30 minutes or overnight before washing with a mild shampoo. Regular use promotes healthy, shiny hair and helps prevent dandruff and hair fall.

4. **Oil Pulling**: Swish 1 tablespoon of sesame oil in your mouth for 10-15 minutes on an empty stomach. Spit it out and rinse with warm water. This practice detoxifies the mouth, improves gum health, and reduces bad breath.

5. **Abhyanga (Self-Massage)**: Warm the oil and use it for a rejuvenating full-body massage to nourish the skin, relieve stress, and promote circulation.
