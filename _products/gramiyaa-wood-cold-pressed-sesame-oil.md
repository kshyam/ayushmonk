This method ensures that all the vital nutrients, flavor, and aroma are preserved, making Gramiyaa Sesame Oil a versatile and nutrient-rich addition to your kitchen, skincare, and hair care routine. 

Packed with healthy fats, antioxidants, and essential vitamins, this sesame oil adds a rich, nutty flavor to your dishes while supporting heart health, improving digestion, and boosting immunity. Beyond cooking, Gramiyaa Sesame Oil works wonders as a natural moisturizer for your skin, leaving it soft and radiant, and as a deep conditioner for your hair, strengthening strands and reducing dandruff. Free from chemicals and additives, this unrefined oil is the ideal choice for those seeking natural, traditional wellness.

### Benefits:
- **Heart Health**: Rich in unsaturated fats that help lower bad cholesterol (LDL) and support cardiovascular health.
- **High in Antioxidants**: Contains sesamin, sesamol, and vitamin E, which protect cells from oxidative damage and boost immunity.
- **Improves Digestion**: Helps soothe inflammation and supports gut health by promoting better digestion and regularity.
- **Skin Moisturizer**: Deeply hydrates and nourishes the skin, making it soft and glowing. It helps reduce signs of aging and protects against sun damage.
- **Hair Nourishment**: Conditions the scalp and strengthens hair follicles, reducing dandruff, split ends, and hair fall while promoting shiny, healthy hair.
- **Ayurvedic Benefits**: Ideal for oil pulling and Ayurvedic massage (Abhyanga), detoxifying the body, improving oral health, and rejuvenating the skin.

### How to Use:
1. **For Cooking**: Use **Gramiyaa Wood Cold Pressed Sesame Oil** for daily cooking, adding a rich, nutty flavor to stir-fries, sautéed dishes, curries, and salads. It's also great for deep-frying or making traditional Indian pickles.
   
2. **For Skin Care**: Apply the oil directly to your skin after a shower for deep moisturization. It hydrates, softens, and nourishes the skin while reducing dryness and irritation. It’s excellent for daily use or as a nighttime skin treatment.

3. **For Hair Care**: Warm the oil and massage it into your scalp and hair. Leave it on for 30 minutes or overnight for deep conditioning, then wash with a mild shampoo. It helps reduce dandruff, strengthens hair, and promotes healthy growth.

4. **Oil Pulling**: Swish 1 tablespoon of sesame oil in your mouth for 10-15 minutes on an empty stomach. Spit it out and rinse with warm water to detoxify your mouth, reduce plaque, and improve gum health.

5. **Ayurvedic Massage (Abhyanga)**: Warm the oil and use it for a full-body massage to relieve tension, improve circulation, and nourish the skin.
