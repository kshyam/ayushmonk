### How to Use:
1. **For Cooking**: Use **Engine Brand Single Pressed Sesame Oil** in daily cooking. Its mild, nutty flavor is perfect for stir-frying, sautéing, deep-frying, and tempering dishes. It also works wonderfully as a dressing for salads or as a base for pickles and marinades.
   
2. **For Skin Care**: Massage the oil gently into your skin as a natural moisturizer. It helps hydrate, nourish, and protect your skin, leaving it soft and smooth. Use daily for better skin elasticity and to reduce dryness and irritation.

3. **For Hair Care**: Warm the oil slightly and apply it to your scalp and hair, massaging it thoroughly. Leave it on for 30 minutes or overnight before washing with a mild shampoo. Regular use strengthens hair, adds shine, and reduces dandruff.

4. **Oil Pulling**: Swish 1 tablespoon of sesame oil in your mouth for 10-15 minutes on an empty stomach. Spit out and rinse with warm water. This ancient Ayurvedic practice helps detoxify the mouth, reduce bad breath, and improve gum health.

5. **Self-Massage (Abhyanga)**: Warm the oil and use it for a relaxing, full-body massage. This helps improve circulation, nourish the skin, and promote a sense of relaxation.
